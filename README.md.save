## Classification of programing paradigms

 ### **Declarative**

* Functional:

* Dataflow

* Logic, Constraint-based

* Template-based

* Structure

### **Imperative**

* Von Neuman
* Interpreted(Scripting)
*Object-oriented

## Methods of rhe programming paradigms:

**INTERPRETED**

**COMPILED**

## Recognize programming languages like: 

There are most used programming languages: 
 * [Python](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/python/)
 * [C](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/c/)
 * [Java](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/java/)
 * [C++](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/c++/)
 * [R](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/r/)
 * [JavaScript](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/javascript/)
 * [PHP](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/php/)
If you are to learnd any, you can press the one of your interest.
### Source code 
 Is the fundamental component of a computer program that is create by you
 so is easy understood. 
 It is can be propriety that is of only one person and open when 
 the code is accessible to the public 
 * The programmers can change and create similar programs with the source code 
 * When you see souce code you can create new or improve other source code 
 * The organization of source code depends of programming language 

### Describe concept and characteristics of data representatoin in structured programming language:
*Identifiers
*Variables
*Constants
*Reserved Words
*Type of data:
     **Primitive data:** they are simple values, manipulated with operations provided directly by the programming language and that can normally be represented and manipulated with the tools available in the computer's machine language
