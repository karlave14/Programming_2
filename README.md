## Classification of programing paradigms

# **Declarative**

* Functional:

* Dataflow

* Logic, Constraint-based

* Template-based

* Structure

# **Imperative**

* Von Neuman
* Interpreted(Scripting)
*Object-oriented

## Methods of rhe programming paradigms:

  **INTERPRETED**

**COMPILED**

Recognize programming languages
Recognize sequential algorithms
Define the concept of source code

### Describe concept and characteristics of data representatoin in structured programming language:
-Identifiers
-Variables
-Constants
-Reserved Words

## Type of data 
 
 A data type is a type together with a collection of operations 
 to manipulate the type

 **Data primitives:** they are simple values, manipulated with operations
 provided directlythey are simple values, manipulated 
 with operations provided directly by the programming language 
 and can normally be represented and manipulated with the tools 
  available in the computer's machine language
   Common examples of primitve data types: 
	* Boolean
	* Character 
	* Double
	* Integer
	* Long
	* Short
	* String
	* Void 


 **Data composite:** they are data types whose values consist of collections
 of data elements also made up of previously definitive data types.Like: 
	* Arrays 
	* Tables 
	* String
 ### Memory and range space for each data type 
	|Data type|Storage| Range |
	| -- | -- | -- |
	|char      |8 bytes|- 128 to 127|
	|INT     |2 byte |  -32768 a 32767  |
	| float   |4 bytes| 3.4E-38 a 3.4E+38  |
	|TINYINT  |1 byte |
	|SMALLINT |2 bytes|
	|MEDIUMINT|3 bytes|
	|DOUBLE	  |8 bytes|
The memory of each datype can be change depeds what is that variable and 
the range it is same. 
 
### Data type conversion 
Is basically converting one type of data type to other to perform some operation. 
 The conversion is done only between those datatypes wherein the conversion is possible ex – char to int and vice versa.
	**Implicit:** is usually performed by the compiler
	 when necessary without any commands by the user.
	**Explicit:**conversion rules out the use of compiler 
	for converting one data type to another instead the user 
	explicitly defines within the program
### Identify the operators of structured programming language: 
	**Conditional:** are used to evaluate a condition that's applied 
	to one or two boolean expressions

	**Logical:** is a symbol or word used to connect two or more expressions 
	like that the value of the compound expression produced depends only on
	that of the original expressions and on the meaning of the operator.
